She is a plain and pensive woman. He is a rather ordinary man who lives in an extraordinary house. This house does algebraic equations and plots violence. One evening, woman, man, and house collide; not all of them survive.

According to Heisenbergâ€™s Uncertainty Principle one can never be exactly sure of both the velocity and the position of a particle. People (and houses) cannot always find out what they want to know. Uncertainty prevails.

Performed as _Vicious Trap_.
