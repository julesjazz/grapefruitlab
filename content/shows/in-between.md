“Try to locate the moon. Look longingly at the sky. Talk to others. Don’t lose track of where you are."

A site-specific performance, down a long dirt road, through the remote desert, encountering the denizens of the place: Echo, Narcissus, the Grey Woman, Turkey, and the Warbler. Medusa invites each of them into her chamber. Influenced by the writings of Edward Abbey, and As Eve Said to the Serpent: On Landscape, Gender, and Art by Rebecca Solnit.

Performed as Vicious Trap.
