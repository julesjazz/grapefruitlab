Songs and stories from Jane Eyre:
a queer adaptation of the classic novel,
featuring [Teacup Gorilla](http://teacupgorilla.com/) +
**Dameon Merkl**.

> This is not for persons who hold solemn doctrines
> about the angelic nature of literature or theater:
> but we are not here to flatter egotism, or prop up humbug;
> we are merely telling the story. We value
> what is good in books; but we believe in the existence of other,
> and more vivid kinds of goodness.
>
> It is narrow-minded to say that we ought to confine ourselves
> to making puddings and knitting
> stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.
