A traveling performance in an historic building, inspired by stories about food and belonging - both historical and contemporary - from the Five Points and Curtis Park neighborhood of Denver.

RECIPE is the result of a performance and story sharing project developed within the community of Curtis Park and Five Points. Through public story sharing events, interviews, and research, stories were collected from residents and business owners about food and how food shapes our lives, relationships, and experiences of home.
