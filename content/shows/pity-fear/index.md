  What does it mean to be a person --
  to have a body, and live in it --
  to make choices, and change over time --
  to tell the truth?

{{ summary | md | safe }}

**Pity+Fear**
is a comic attempt at a one-woman tragedy,
featuring two women and a guitar.
Over the course of the evening,
Miriam & Josie fail to grapple with queer identity,
platonic realism,
the conflicting myths of Agraulos,
and what to order for dinner.

Written by Miriam Suzanne,
with original music & lyrics
by Josselyn Cool (Better Selfs, Teacup Gorilla).
Designed & developed with Julie Rada, Kenny Storms,
Ben Meyer Reimer, and Erin Rollman.
Thanks to Buntport Theater for
generously providing us a space to perform.
