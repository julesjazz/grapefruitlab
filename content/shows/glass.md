An in-the-moment performance meditation on Indra’s Net,
the phenomenon that alchemies sand into glass,
and what exactly constitutes polite behavior.

Source material derived from such texts as Emily Post’s The Rules,
Brian Greene’s Darkness on the Edge of the Universe,
and Beverly Cleary’s Ramona Forever.
Julie may or may not discover pomegranate seeds in her panties.

Performed as _Vicious Trap_.
