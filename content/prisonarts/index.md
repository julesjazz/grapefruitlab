Action & Change Theatre (ACT) Ensemble
is the name of Grapefruit Lab’s residency
at Colorado’s Sterling Correctional Facility.
From May 2018 through September 2019,
Misty Saribal and Julie Rada
facilitated a theatre and performance studies workshop
for an ensemble of incarcerated artists.
ACT Ensemble performed two productions:

- _Mercury in Retrograde_ (August 9, 2018),
  an original devised performance
  based on the adventures of the god Mercury
  as he flew through time,
  disrupting the moments of everyday peoples’ lives.
- _Monologue Mixtape_ (February 2, 2019),
  a showcase of monologues
  excerpted from award-winning contemporary plays
  of the U.S. American theatre
  and arranged into a collaborative hour of performance.

ACT Ensemble then embarked on an investigation
at the intersects of performance, art, dance, aesthetics, narrative,
and the meaning of theatre/performance in prison.
Throughout, the ensemble incorporated compositional and embodied practices
to discover artistic excellence, develop new work,
and deploy practice-based-research methods.

Though since disbanded, while active, ACT Ensemble boldly stated:

ACT Ensemble’s approach
is philosophically oriented toward
the potential for liberation through art
and the intrinsic value of art for all lives.
ACT Ensemble believes high-quality,
aesthetically-rich art should be accessible to all,
rather than inaccessible and elitist.
ACT Ensemble envisions a world of accessible art spaces,
shared and abundant resources for artists,
and a world without prisons.
As we strive for this revolutionary future,
in the present,
ACT has the privilege of creating outstanding art
with genius incarcerated artists
and sharing moments of humanity and brilliance
by accomplishing the near impossible --
performing art in spaces of confinement.
